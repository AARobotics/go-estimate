A suite of filtering algorithms written in Go. Currently implements the following filters:

* [Bootstrap Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter#The_bootstrap_filter) also known as Particle filter
* [Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) also known as Linear Kalman Filter
* [Extended Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Extended_Kalman_filter) also known as non-linear Kalman Filter
* [Unscented Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Unscented_Kalman_filter) also known as Sigma-point filter
